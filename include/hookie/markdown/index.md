### Welcome
In this KSM we will demonstrate 3 different ways of brining a website down.

This website that you're seeing will be the victim,
it runs the popular web server Apache 2 in its default configuration.

If you reload the page it will (most likely -its random-) change the theme, you can use this as a way to tell how fast (or slow) is the server in replying to your reload request
